- Topics are categorized according to their levels (0, 1, 2, 3+) in the roadmap page
- Each level has an assessment required to enter that level, only available after completing all prior level topics
- On topic click, a popup appears asking the user for their next action
    - Start learning the topic
    - Start the topic assessment
        - If passed, mark the topic as completed
        - Else, prompt again and recommend retaking the topicz
